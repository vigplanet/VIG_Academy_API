# Concept

This package includes the .NET and .NET Core assemblies required to create and render pixel-perfect reports:
* [PageReport](https://www.grapecity.com/activereportsnet/docs/v16/online/GrapeCity.ActiveReports~GrapeCity.ActiveReports.PageReport.html) is base class for Page/RDL reports (GrapeCity ActiveReports formats based on MS-RDL format).
* [SectionReport](https://www.grapecity.com/activereportsnet/docs/v16/online/GrapeCity.ActiveReports~GrapeCity.ActiveReports.SectionReport.html) is base class for XML/RPX and code-based Section reports.
