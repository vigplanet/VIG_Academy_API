# Concept

This package includes the .NET and .NET Core assemblies required to create and render RDF image: [SectionDocument](https://www.grapecity.com/activereportsnet/docs/v16/online/GrapeCity.ActiveReports.Document~GrapeCity.ActiveReports.Document.SectionDocument.html)

RDF format is GrapeCity ActiveReports internal binary vector image format.

Section reports use RDF format for rendering and exports, Page/RDL reports can use it too with package [GrapeCity.ActiveReports.Export.Rdf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GrapeCity.ActiveReports.Export.Rdf/).
