* Different possibilities to pivot and aggregate data.
* Rich data visualization.
* Popular export formats (like PDF/Excel/Word).
* And a lot more (https://www.grapecity.com/activereportsnet).

# Concept

This package includes the .NET and .NET Core assemblies required to export to different binary image formats.

Please check the samples how to export:
* [Page/RDL reports](https://github.com/activereports/Samples16/tree/main/API/PageAndRDL/Export).
* [Section reports](https://github.com/activereports/Samples16/tree/main/API/Section/Export).

## Note

TIFF export does not use colored settings by default, please use LZW compression for colored export.
