# [GrapeCity Documents for Imaging - Windows](https://www.grapecity.com/documents-api-imaging)

GrapeCity.Documents.Imaging.Windows is a platform-specific library that allows
[GcImaging](https://www.grapecity.com/documents-api-imaging) and other 
[GrapeCity Document APIs](https://www.grapecity.com/documents-api)
to use Windows system APIs when running on Windows operating systems.
It provides support for loading information about system font links and EUDC fonts from the Windows registry.
It also enables the use of high-performance Windows Imaging Component (WIC) APIs for
loading, saving, and transforming images in PNG, JPEG, JPEGXR, TIFF (including
TIFF with JPEGs), BMP, ICO (loading only), GIF formats and rendering
high-quality graphics and text based on Direct2D APIs.

This library is compatible with .NET 6, .NET 5, .NET Core 3.x and 2.x, .NET Standard 2.x, .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher. 

All features are supported on Windows only. If referenced when running on other operating systems, this library will do nothing.
